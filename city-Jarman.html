      <!--overview-->
      Perhaps one of the center of the world for the 20th century, Berlin is a city
      that has seen periods of intense change, destruction, and revival. The city cycles between periods of
      oppression and intense freedom, making it one of the most exciting cities in the world. Berlin makes New York
      City seem narcoleptic, and the days of bland overcooked German cuisine are slowly dissapearing, being replaced
      by the international cuisines from new migrant populations that are reinventing the answer to what it means to
      be German. Come see the brutalist monuments to former regimes, as well as the architectural and social replies to
      the past.

      Things to do
<br>
<br>
<!--nightlife-->
  <!--Buck and Breck-->
  <img width="400"src=buck&breck.jpg>
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind a rather an unmarked door in the center of Berlin is a Buck and Breck, a fantastic entry into the world of the
  cocktail bar. Buck and Breck combines the "hidden gem" nature of Berlin with a stellar cocktail program. Plus, the
  bartender is nice. Just go.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!--Heidegluhen-->
  <img src=heide.jpg>
  <br>
  <br>
  Let's not kid ourselves, you are probably not going to get a lot of sleep dueing your trip to Berlin. One of the main culprits of
  this would be the club Heidegluhen, a hidden spot that has some of the funkiest parties. Consistently good unlike some other clubs,
  if you can find it, Heidegluhen is worth the trek and wait to get inside a musical wonderland. It also has a surprisingly good cafeteria,
  which during your whole weekend there, you might have to visit.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the head honcho of the club city is Berghain. Residing in and old East German factory, Berghain is a legend for a reason. With a somewhat
  selective door policy, the wait is worth it if you really want to go. The DJs are world class, the bathroom line is always long, and the sense of
  freedom is very present. Aslo, they have a great mango smoothie.
  <br>
  <br>
<!--visiting sights-->

<br>
<br>
  The Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park is perhaps the most awe-inspiring monuments I have ever seen. A giant dedication
  to the Soviet soldiers who fell during the Second World War, the mini-park inside a park survived the fall of the Soviet Union, a lasting
  monument highlighting the myth of the protecting soldier.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  In a city that has a less than positive past with Jewish peoples, the Jewish Museum is an incredible resource to learn about Jewish
  culture and history, as well as their convergence with Germany. The museum also is a fantastic example of the intersection of monumenture
  and history, using large building pieces of art in tandem with history to convey a powerful message.

  <br>
  <br>
  The Pergammon Museum is so large, that it contains several ancient buildings withing its rooms. Like with many colonial powers, Germany has a strong
  archaelogical history. The pieces are beautiful, and like all German museums, it is conscious of the ethical dilemnas that it has as a museum,
  a child of colonialism.

      <!--Doner Kebab? or something more Fleischerei-->

      Less Expensive:
      <br>
  <br>
      <img src=domke.jpg>
      <br>
      <br>
      I generally hold a very poor view of what some would call the German cuisine, but if you have a meat deficiency,
      then it's the country for you! Head over to Fleischerei Domke for some German meat classics, an old butchers that
      is also a lunch counter for those craving iron.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src=doner.jpg>
      <br>
      <br>
      If you like thinly sliced meat, then you probably will like the Doner Kebab, a turkish innovation that has become a staple of the German
      economy. The best place is the one that is closest to you, it doesn't matter where you get it, it will always be good, and anyone
      who tries to argue differently is someone you should not associate with.
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--KnodelWirtschafft-->
      Somewhat Expensive:
      <br>
  <br>
      <img src=knodeln.jpg>
      <br>
      <br>
      If you want another classic German meal, then Knodelwirtschaft does a wonderful Knodeln, or German dumplings. It's a very small and cute restaurant
      wherein you shall be jammed together.
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--Chunking noodles-->
      <img src=noodles.jpg>
      <br>
      <br>
      If you get old of the German usage of spice, then you should stop at Chunking Noodles, a former pop-up turned brick and mortar that specializes
      in sichuanese noodles. Sichuanese noodles are known for their mala taste, or the numbing, sour, and spicy flavor that comes from the use of
      sichuanese peppercorns. The restaurant also has a pretty great drinks program.
      Middle of the road
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--Ernst, not that Billy WAgner restaurant-->
      Expensive:
      <br>
  <br>
      <img src=ernst.jpg>
      <br>
      <br>
      If you are so inclined, you can shell out in one of the pretty good Michelin starred restaurants in Berlin. Perhaps the best is Ernst, a name that is
      consistently on the Worlds Best Restaurants list (however problematic they may be). While some people may tell you to go to Nobelhart and Schmutzig,
      dont. Billy Wagner has always been a jerk to me and keeps trying to flirt with my friends. Anyways, Ernst has a fantastic drinks program, both
      alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and the ingredients are hyper local, although they combine it with international methods to come out with a stunning plating
      for every one of their 20-30 courses. Very Worth It. Also, the chefs also serve you and talk with you about lord knows what, creating a wonderfully
      casual vibe.
